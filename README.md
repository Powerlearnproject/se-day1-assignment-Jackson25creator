Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the development, management and distribution of a software to solve a real world  problem by;
ensuring reliability,efficiency,scalability,flexibility and security.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Masterinng complixity - structured programming and object-oriented design helped manage complexity.
2. Mastering process - adoption of Waterfall and Agile development models improved planning, tracking and execution.
3. Mastering machines - advanced computing power, cloud computing and AI enabled highily efficient scalable and secure software solutions.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
1. Planning - timelines, budget and team roles are defined.
2.Designing - technical architecture and general appearance is defined.
3.Development - coding of the software is done.
4.Testing - debugging and features evaluation is done.
5.Deployment -realized stable version is released to the market.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfaall is leaner while Agile is flexible.
2. Waterfall is hard to modify requirements while Agile is flexible in applying changes.
3. User input is miminimal in Waterfall compared to Agile where feedback is not restricted.
4. Testing is done at the end in Waterfall while in Agile its done after each sprint.
5. Waterfall is best for fixed-scope project while Agile is best for evolving projects like mobile apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer - tackles the core of software development life cycle
- Quality assurance engineer - is an input of human software interaction and testing.
- Project Manager steers the whole team in software development, managing risks and ensuring timely release.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Improves efficiency through  autocompleting, debugging and code highlighting.
2. Enables collaboration, change tracking and rollbacks to previous changes.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Rapid tech-advancements - adopting continuous learning and new technologies.
2. Time constraints - adapting to agile methodologies.
3. Security venarability - ensure strong authentification.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing - tests individualcomponents for correctness.
2. Integration testing - ensures difeerent modules work together.
3. System testing - verifies the complete system functionality.
4. Acceptance testing - ensures user feedback is considered. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
